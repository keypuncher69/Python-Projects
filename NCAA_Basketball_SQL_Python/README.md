# NCAA BasketBall Data Wrangling with Python and SQL, Performing queries
This project involves the use of Python to import data using API and wrangle data in SQL. I also perform some queries (present in the documentation).

The database is designed to track game and season performance for each of the included teams of NCAA Basketball.

The database shows the following for each game: stadium, home and away teams, points, rebounds, field goals attempted and made, free throws attempted and made, rebounds (offensive and defensive), assists, turnovers, personal fouls, and blocked shots, information about each team (school, name, conference, etc.) and each stadium (name, address, city, state, zip, etc.). 

I had to store the data in .json files, as API calls were limited, and my testing iterations were using up the available calls.

Skills utilized:
*  Data Cleaning
*  Data Wrangling
*  SQL
*  Python
*  Use of API
