# NCAA BasketBall Data Wrangling with Python and SQL, Performing queries
This project involves the use of Python to import data using API and wrangle data in SQL. I also perform some queries (present in the documentation).

I had to store the data in .json files, as API calls were limited, and my iterations were using up the available calls.

Skills utilized:
*  Data Cleaning
*  Data Wrangling
*  SQL
*  Python
*  Use of API
