# Typing Tracker using Python and Selenium Webdriver 
I created this project to improve my typing speed and track my progress. What this program does is, once run, it automatically opens up 10fastfingers.com on your Google Chrome, rejects cookies and clicks in the typing bar waiting for you to type away. Once you're done, it automatically extracts your score, and refreshes the page to go 4 more times. Your score is extracted each time, and after the 5th time, it closes the browser and displays two graphs: One graph displays the 5 scores gathered today, and the other graph compares the averages of 5 scores today and the previous days. 

Basically, all you need to do is just run this program and the computer does everything else for you and shows you the progress of your typing speed averaged over 5 tries.

I did create an executable version of the program, however it was too large to upload to GitHub. All you need to do is run the typingtracker.py file.
