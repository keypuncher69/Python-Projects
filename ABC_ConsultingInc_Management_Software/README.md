# ABC Consulting Inc. Management Software

This is software for a hypothetical company that I made as a project to put my Python skills to the test. This Python program allows storage and retrieval of staff records, calculation of bonuses, and analyzing metrics to motivate employees as well as putting a few on probation due to lack of performance. The staff employees are of two types: consultants and directors. 

A lot of code, but enjoyed the process of building the program, using concepts learned. Please feel free to refer to the documentation or contact me for any queries!
